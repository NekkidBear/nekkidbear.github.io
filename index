My expertise spans remote troubleshooting, utilizing various tools and systems to diagnose, repair, and escalate issues. I am proficient in Windows, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office, and various internally developed software suites.</p>

This continuous learning, combined with my experience in IT support, positions me well for roles in data analysis and software development.</p>

I am dedicated to finding creative and effective solutions that not only resolve issues but also exceed user expectations. My proactive approach includes following up with users to verify issue resolution and prevent future problems.</p>
